/**
 * This is an addon to [[ResolverGuard]] functionality for features that cannot be determined by
 * only looking at the unresolved plan. [[Resolver]] will throw this control-flow exception
 * when it encounters some explicitly unsupported feature. It will later be caught by
 * [[HybridAnalyzer]] to abort single-pass analysis without comparing single-pass and fixed-point
 * results. The motivation for this feature is the same as for the [[ResolverGuard]] - we want to
 * have an explicit allowlist of the unimplemented features that we are aware of, and
 * `UNSUPPORTED_SINGLE_PASS_ANALYZER_FEATURE` will signal us the rest of the gaps.
 *
 * For example, [[UnresolvedRelation]] can be intermediately resolved by [[ResolveRelations]] as
 * [[UnresolvedCatalogRelation]] or a [[View]] (among all others). Say that for now the views
 * are not implemented, and we are aware of that, so [[ExplicitlyUnsupportedResolverFeature]] will
 * be thrown in the middile of the single-pass analysis to abort it.
